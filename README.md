ImageJ Macros used by Lenhart Lab.

The ROI Manager Macro enables the user to set each channel into the desired display settings, 
set the measurement tool to a segmented line of the desired width,
open channel windows such as "Brightness and Contrast" and "Channels Tool",
guides the user through measuring each cell type defined by ImageJ's endogenous "Roi-group table" plugin,
sets ImageJ into the desired channel for measurement, 
then measures the positions set in the ROI manager.

The Roi-group table plugin is used in all of these macros and cited below:

//This macro will do the following, listed in chronological order: 
//Set the channels into the correct display colors.
//Display the channels in the "Composite Projection Max" setting.
//Sets the measuring tool to a segmented line with a width of the desired amount of pixels.
//Runs the "Roi-group table" endogenous plugin.
//Opens the ROI Manager, the Brightness and Contrast Menu, then the Channels Tool.
//Leads you through measuring different cell types determined by the settings of the Roi-group table plugin.
//Sets ImageJ into the channel you wish to make measurements in and then measures your ROI's. 

//To comment out code, put a "//" at the start of every line you wish to exclude.  This also works for making comments. 
//ImageJ will ignore any commented code when running the macro.

//Sets channels into the correct colors.  
//In the "Stack.setChannel(n)" command, "n" should be replaced with the number of the channel you are trying to change.  You must use a numerical value or else this will not work.
//In the "run(color) command, "color" should be replaced with the color you are setting the channel to.  You must spell the channel exactly as it is shown in the Channels tool.

//To change the type of line you are tracing (i.e. segmented, non-segmented, etc.) you will need to change the third line.  
//The third line has the format "setTool("line type").  Right now, the "line type" is set to "polyline" to indicate a segmented line is desired.
